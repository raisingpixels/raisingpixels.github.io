It’s 6:30 AM. My almost-3-year-old is beginning to stir. I have maybe 10 minutes before he needs breakfast and the morning chaos begins in earnest.

Do I want to spend 3 of those precious minutes walking around the house turning on lights? Or do I want to spend them writing a prompt that could generate an entire web page, article outline, or app structure?

The answer is obvious. But it took me a while to realize that the same systems thinking I apply to code—eliminating repetitive tasks, automating the boring stuff, optimizing for efficiency—could completely transform how our family operates.

## The Math That Changed My Perspective

Here’s what 3 minutes actually means when you’re a parent developer:

**Daily light routine:** 3 minutes walking around turning lights on/off
**Weekly total:** 21 minutes
**Monthly total:** 90 minutes
**What I could build instead:** A landing page, blog post, or small feature

That’s just lights. Add in all the other 2-3 minute tasks we do manually every day, and suddenly you’re looking at reclaiming hours of time per month.

But here’s the kicker: those 3 minutes aren’t just about writing 3 minutes worth of code. They’re 3 minutes spent writing a prompt that generates something that would have taken 30 minutes to build manually—or more. That's the difference between repetitive mundane tasks and launching a new website, book, or side hustle.

## From Manual Tasks to Automated Systems

The shift happened when I started seeing our home the way I see a codebase: full of repetitive processes that were begging to be automated.

When I catch myself doing the same 2-3 minute task for the third time in a week, I ask: “How could I automate this?”

The answer usually involves Home Assistant, iOS Shortcuts, or a simple workflow automation. Not because I love tinkering with smart home tech (though I do), but because I love having more time to write prompts that build really cool and useful stuff.

## The Core Automations That Actually Matter

### Smart Lighting with Home Assistant

**The manual version:** Walk around every morning and evening, flipping switches or adjusting lamps in 4-5 rooms.
**Time cost:** 3 minutes, twice daily
**Automation:** Home Assistant controls all our smart bulbs based on sunrise/sunset and time-based schedules.

**The setup:**

- [Sengled \(Zigbee\) bulbs](https://amzn.to/3GUaBLi) everywhere a light bulb goes (cheaper than [Philips Hue bulbs](https://amzn.to/44U60AP), work just as well for basic automation)
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) running on a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://amzn.to/3IAbbyj)
- Simple automations like lights on at 30 minutes before sunset, gradual dimming after 8 PM, off at 10 PM

**Real impact:** Those 6 minutes daily become 6 minutes to prompt AI for a blog post outline, component code, or troubleshooting help.

### Circadian Rhythm Automation with iOS Shortcuts

**The problem:** Blue light from screens and regular white lights after sunset messes with sleep quality. Poor sleep = terrible coding sessions the next day.

**The manual version:** Remember to manually adjust every screen and light bulb color temperature after sunset, then remember to change them back in the morning.

**The automation:** iOS Shortcuts that run automatically at sunset and sunrise.

**My shortcuts:**

- **“Evening Mode”:** Turns all compatible lights red/orange, sets iPhone to red screen filter, adjusts iPad display warmth with Night Mode
- **“Morning Mode”:** Returns everything to normal daylight settings

**Setup:** Use the Shortcuts app’s “Automation” feature with time-based triggers. The shortcuts talk to Home Assistant via the app and adjust iOS device settings directly.

**Real impact:** Better sleep means more productive coding sessions. Plus, 2-3 minutes saved twice daily that I can spend writing prompts for tomorrow’s project.

### Content Workflow Automation

**The manual version:** Write a blog post, then manually cross-post to Medium, Dev.to, LinkedIn, or X. Format each one differently. Remember to include proper tags and descriptions for each platform.

**The automation:** Zapier/Make workflow triggered when I publish a new post on my Hugo site.

**My workflow:**

1. Publish post on raisingpixels.dev (Hugo site deployed via GitHub)
2. Zapier detects new RSS item
3. Automatically formats and posts to Dev.to with proper tags
4. Creates LinkedIn post with excerpt and link
5. Queues X thread in Buffer

**Want to copy this exact workflow?** I've created a [Make blueprint](https://gist.github.com/raisingpixels/a56bf0a17893b50ff08c79f7edd01db3) that includes the RSS monitoring, Claude integration for content formatting, Dev.to posting, and Twitter thread creation. Just [import it](https://help.make.com/blueprints#5anCi), connect your accounts, and you're ready to automate your cross-posting.

**Real impact:** What used to take 30-60 minutes of manual editing and posting now takes 30 seconds of publishing. That’s a lot more time I can spend on new content or features.

## Why Prompts Beat Manual Work

This is where 2025 parent developers have a massive advantage. Those reclaimed 3-5 minute windows aren’t just good for writing a few lines of code—they’re perfect for writing prompts that generate entire solutions.

**What 3 minutes of prompting can do:**

- Write a complete React component with proper TypeScript types
- Turn notes into a blog post draft with intro, main points, and conclusion
- Create landing page HTML/CSS with responsive design
- Specify a database schema with relationships
- Generate API endpoint documentation
- Draft an email marketing sequence

**What 3 minutes of manual coding creates:**

- Maybe one function (lol)
- A few CSS rules
- Basic HTML structure for one section

The ROI isn’t even close.

## Implementation Strategy for Busy Parents

### Start Small

Don’t try to automate everything at once. Pick the one manual task that annoys you most and automate that first. For me, it was lights because I was doing it multiple times every single day.

### Use What You Already Have

You probably already have a smartphone, which means you already have access to iOS Shortcuts (or Android equivalents). Start there before buying new hardware.

### Calculate Your Time

Track how long tasks actually take. You might be surprised—what feels like “30 seconds” is often 2-3 minutes when you include walking between rooms, finding the right switch, etc.

### Think in Systems

Don’t just automate individual tasks. Look for related tasks you can automate together. Evening light routine + screen color temperature + do-not-disturb settings can all be part of one “bedtime prep” automation.

## The Tools That Actually Work

**Home Assistant:** Free, powerful, runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.to/3IAbbyj). Incredible flexibility and privacy-friendly.

**iOS Shortcuts:** Built into iPhones, easy to start with, surprisingly powerful for device and app automation.

**Zapier/Make:** Great for connecting different web services. Zapier’s free tier only allows single-step workflows, but Make’s free tier handles most personal automation needs.

**Smart plugs:** Cheapest way to make “dumb” devices automated. Control lamps, coffee makers, etc. For Home Assistant compatibility, grab [Zigbee smart plugs like these](https://amzn.to/3GLHHgw).

## What I Learned About Automation and Parenting

A little automation can eliminate a lot of the mental overhead of remembering to do small tasks throughout the day.

When you’re already managing nap schedules, meal times, development activities, and keeping tiny humans alive, every automated task is one less thing competing for your mental resources.

Those resources are better spent on creative problem-solving, writing effective prompts, and building things that matter.

## The Compound Effect

Here’s my current weekly time savings breakdown:

- **Lighting automation:** 42 minutes
- **Screen/sleep automation:** 14 minutes
- **Content cross-posting:** 45 minutes
- **Various smart plug automations:** 15 minutes

**Total weekly savings:** Nearly 2 hours

That’s 2 hours I can spend writing prompts, building features, learning new tools, or (let’s be honest) sometimes just sleeping.

But the real win is the mental energy. When basic household tasks happen automatically, I have more brain space for creative work and more patience for toddler negotiations about whether 2 bananas constitutes a healthy dinner.

## Your Turn

Start with one automation this week. Pick the task that you do most frequently and that annoys you most. Time how long it actually takes. Then ask yourself: “How would I automate this if it were a repetitive function in my code?”

The same principles apply: identify the repetitive pattern, find the right tools, build the automation, test it, and iterate.

Your future self—the one with 30 extra minutes per week to write prompts that build amazing things—will thank you.

And your toddler will definitely notice that you’re less grumpy about turning on lights in the morning.
